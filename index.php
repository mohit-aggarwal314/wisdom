        <p class="wisdomscoolpara">“Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today.”<br><br>
Learning is a continuous process. As Society keeps evolving all the time, education must change too along with for better times. While technology enables the transmission of knowledge easier and within everyone’s grasp, it leaves us with many unanswered questions. We desperately need to make the best of today for learning and let our initiatives transform our children to create a better tomorrow.<br><br>
Choosing the right school for your child is a serious matter. Every child deserves a learning environment in which the child feels safe and secure.<br></p>
<div id="msg" style="display:none">At The Wisdom School of Academics & Sports, we believe in empowering our children in such a manner that they act as representatives of a meaningful and value-based society. Our teaching which is complete and comprehensive actually complements this philosophy of life. We help our students imbibe the 21st century learning skills, often called the 4 C's: critical thinking, creative thinking, communicating, and collaborating. These skills help them learn, and have happy experiences in school and beyond. Critical thinking is focused, careful analysis of something to better understand it. Creative thinking is expansive, open-ended invention and discovery of possibilities. Communication is, analysing the situation means thinking about the subject, purpose, sender, receiver, medium, and context of a message and lucidly conveying it. Collaboration is allocating resources and responsibilities ensuring that all members of a team can work optimally. We enjoy this journey with our children, reliving and rediscovering the magic of learning. Education research shows that most school variables, considered separately have at most small effects on learning. The real pay-off comes when individual variables are combined to reach critical mass and create the conditions under which that can occur.<br><br>
We set high standards and expectations for each student in the spheres of academic performance, physical development, co-curricular participation and responsible citizenship. It is with pride that we uphold these values, and ask each of our students to commit to them throughout their journey of learning in TWS...<br><br>
‘You need a village to raise a child’-John Dewey<br><br>
Let us all contribute to the all-round development of the children, so that their learning experience is rich and varied. I hope that the forthcoming session brings each one of us joy, cheer, good luck, health, and wisdom, true to the title of this institution. Let us serve others willingly, graciously and selflessly. Let us not expect anything in return for our service, because there is greater pleasure in giving than in receiving.<br><br>
“I wish good luck to the team of The Wisdom School in their future endeavour."</div><br>
