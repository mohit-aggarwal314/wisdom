        <p class="wisdomscoolpara">
          As I walk down the hallways of School every day, I hear the chatter of eager minds,    the shouts of excitement from learners, the thump of dancing feet and sound of melodious voices harmonizing. The perpetual energy, movement and enthusiasm permeates the atmosphere at The Wisdom School of Academics & Sports Tarn Taran<br><br>
          We are a school with a difference!<br><br>
          We value individualism, creativity, innovation and humanitarianism and strive to nurture these values in our students. Besides rigorous scholastic facets of a child, we aim not to just impart knowledge, but also to inculcate wisdom, compassion, tolerance and respect for diversity which is all pervasive, in Nature as well as nature’s most wonderful creation- The Man. For us it is important that a child explores and finds his/her strength in order to attain his/her fullest potential. We want our boys to respect the other gender and we want our girls to explore newer heights.<br><br>

    Another area of our focus is physical development of each child. Though physical fitness is a valued domain in education, previous years have taught us the value of physical fitness like never before! The Wisdom School is determined, through its curriculum, to keep body mind and Spirit of each student in consonance for their holistic development.<br><br>
    As a school, we think about how to engage students and hold their attention. We wish and strive that their learning gets reflected in their life. We continuously upgrade our teaching skills and technology as well as our academic programmes. In all pervasive technological world, we appeal young minds by incorporating smart boards, computers and technological devices into teaching learning processes.<br><br>
    Our mission is to continuously do what we have always done: develop the school and students with integrated values & also to give our students the best opportunities and best all round growth. Our vision is to produce conscientious, smart and confident citizens who will go out into the world and make us proud.
